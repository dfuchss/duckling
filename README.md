# ducking (Fork)
[![Docker Push](https://github.com/dfuchss/duckling/actions/workflows/deploy-docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dfuchss/duckling/actions/workflows/deploy-docker.yml)

This fork aims to provide an docker image.

The image is build as `:latest` using Github Actions from the current [main branch](https://github.com/dfuchss/duckling/tree/main).

The [image](https://github.com/dfuchss/duckling/pkgs/container/duckling) will be build once a week (or if triggered manually because I see that there's an update).
The main branch will be kept up to date via cron with upstream.

Use the following as image name: `ghcr.io/dfuchss/duckling`

The original README can be found [here](https://github.com/dfuchss/duckling/blob/main/README.md)
